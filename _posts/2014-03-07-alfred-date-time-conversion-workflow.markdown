This Alfred workflow is a serious timesaver (pun intended, I suppose). Simply type 'df' before any sort of timestamp or time string it populates the results with different formats of the time. Before I found this, I was copying a Epoch time (Unix timestamp integer), pasting it into a field on an epoch time conversion site, and observing the results. Now I can find out without leaving the application I'm in. Perfect!
