The time is almost upon me to quickly and efficiently set up a new (well, new to me) OS X workstation. Luckily, I already have a few things in place to help me do this. I forsee the steps to follow something like this:

1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
2. Tap [homebrew-casks](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask)
3. Install [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) via [homebrew-cask][1648-001]
4. Log in to dropbox
5. install [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)
6. Run [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to symlink dotfiles & cask file
7. Run the cask file to automatically install my development environment and essential apps
8. Run [Sublimall](http://sublimall.org/) to sync [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) preferences and configuration
9. Start working

Hopefully with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick), cask files, and Sublimall, I should be up and running with very little time spent.
